# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

## About

BookBot parses through text files to analyze books. It counts the total number of words in a book and tracks how many times each character appears, displaying the results in a sorted list.

## Usage

Run the program by passing the path to a book file as a command-line argument:

```bash
python main.py <path_to_book>
```

**Example:**

```bash
python main.py books/frankenstein.txt
```

**Note:** Book files are not included in this repository. You'll need to provide your own text files to analyze.
